            About Green Villages International.
        </h1>
        <p className={`${styles.paragraph} mt-5`}>
        Green Villages International (GreVillas Int’l) is a Community Based Organization (CBO) formed on 20th Jan 2019 but registered in Jan 2020.   
        </p>
        <p className={`${styles.paragraph} mt-5`}>
        It covers Ikolomani sub-county in Kakamega County.
        </p>
        <p className={`${styles.paragraph} mt-5`}>
        It is a non-political and non-religious group whose main objective is to improve livelihoods in the community through sustainable utilization of natural resources and provision of regenerative agriculture and other socio- economic services to all households in the target sub-county.
        </p>
        <p className={`${styles.paragraph} mt-5`}>
        Our primary focus is to restore, protect and conserve our resources both on-farm and in the natural habitats.
        </p>
        <p className={`${styles.paragraph} mt-5`}>
        This will entail designing and implementing interventions that will mitigate the adverse effects of climate change such as;
        </p>
        <p className={`${styles.paragraph} mt-5`}>
        On-farm and off farm soil and water conservation and management, identification, conservation and multiplication of indigenous flora and fauna, restoration, conservation and protection of degraded public and private habitats. 
        </p>
        <p className={`${styles.paragraph} mt-5`}>
        The CBO will further prioritize promotion of household nutritious food production, preservation and storage.
        </p>
        <p className={`${styles.paragraph} mt-5`}>
        To achieve this, we shall design and implement a universal input access program that encompass community savings & credit input support program. 
        </p>
        <p className={`${styles.paragraph} mt-5`}>
        This will be complemented by innovative sustainable knowledge and skills development and dissemination program. 
        </p>
        <p className={`${styles.paragraph} mt-5`}>
        The aim is to increase agricultural productivity to provide surplus for the market. 
        </p>
        <p className={`${styles.paragraph} mt-5`}>
        Additionally, a Community Resource Centre (CRC) will be established on identified public land or asset and developed to facilitate collective action in planning; 
        </p>
        <p className={`${styles.paragraph} mt-5`}>
        Production, marketing and value addition as well as provide long-term business linkages for all actor’s, service providers and building partnerships with government and other strategic organizations in each project area in our case the ward.
        </p>
        <p className={`${styles.paragraph} mt-5`}>
        We have developed a consultative community mobilization concept where we provide sufficient forums for Government appointed grassroots leaders, community opinion leaders to contribute to the establishment and operationalization of structures and institutions.
        </p>
        <p className={`${styles.paragraph} mt-5`}>
        The aim is to empower the community members to take over the leadership of the community resources and support structures established in order to effectively coordinate all activities related to ecosystem restoration; 
        </p>
        <p className={`${styles.paragraph} mt-5`}>
        And regenerative farming practices. 
        </p>
        <p className={`${styles.paragraph} mt-5`}>
        This we believe will lead to sustainable development of our communities in line with the following quote by Kenya Community Development Foundation (KCDF).
        </p>
        <blockquote className="relative p-4 text-xl italic quote">
            <p className={`${styles.paragraph} mt-5`}>
            "systemic and enduring change is possible when communities can initiate and drive their development agenda, work with governments and other stakeholders to access basic rights and services as well as harness and grow their resources"

            Program Approach
        </h1>
        <p className={`${styles.paragraph} mt-5`}>
        Our approach will focus on addressing the following systemic challenges;

        <p className={`${styles.paragraph} mt-5`}>
        Weak grassroot institutions, inadequate evidence based and non-involvement of beneficiaries in planning and program implementation.

        <p className={`${styles.paragraph} mt-5`}>
        The challenges will be addressed by building strong institutions with competent leaders of integrity, developing tools for baseline; 
        </p>
        <p className={`${styles.paragraph} mt-5`}>
        And continuous data collection and establishment and operationalization of committees, which bring together all relevant actors and stakeholders.
